# BlockAllSteamInvites

Steam script to block all friend requests. 
(often happens with traders that receive a whole lot of bot requests of level 0 and blocked users)

Much like the ignore all the just ignores all the friend requests the new function block all will block all the friend requests.

There are errors that popup in console such as:
Refused to set unsafe header "Content-Length"

but the errors do not seem to affect the running and outcomes of the code.

Please send feedback if you find that it does not work or runs into errors

Thanks

Andrew Parkes
