# Installation:

**Google Chrome:** You will need to install this script using the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). This way the script should be able to run nicely and you will also benefit from automatic updates when new version are available.

**Firefox:** You will obviously need the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) to be able to install and use this script. If you are using Firefox 30+ you need to make sure you use Greasemonkey version 2.2+ or the script won't work.

# Future additions:

Being able to block only:

* Private accounts.
* VAC or Trading banned accounts.
* Long time used account.
* Accounts with items in their inventory.
* Accounts with no games.
* Account with very few hours being active.
* Account with very few game hours.
* Bot ban that looks at multiple pieces of information to decide if a user is a bot.

Thanks Hope you like it :D
